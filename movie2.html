<b>Synopsis:</b>One month after his breakup with Tessa Young, Hardin Scott meets an unknown man he rebuffs when he attempts to talk to him. Meanwhile, on her first day as an intern at Vance Publishing, Tessa shares an awkward encounter with her new coworker Trevor Matthews. Kimberly takes her to her office, where she ends up working all night. The next morning, Christian Vance, impressed with Tessa's work, takes her to a Seattle conference with Kimberly and Trevor. After getting a tattoo, Hardin returns to the frat house, where he meets up with his friends but leaves after Molly tries to seduce him to forget about Tessa.Tessa goes to a nightclub with Trevor and Kimberly to celebrate the expansion of Vance. In a drunken stupor, she calls Hardin, who arrives to see Trevor half-dressed due to Tessa trying to clean Trevor's suit, which she accidentally spilled wine on. Trevor leaves, and Tessa fights with Hardin before the two have sex. The morning after, Tessa and Hardin argue about the previous night, which leads to her telling him that it was a mistake and that she kissed someone at the club. Hardin retaliates by lying that he slept with Molly. Trevor gifts Tessa a cost analysis and negotiated terms for a used car with company-paid insurance, and she kisses him. She returns to the apartment where she and Hardin previously lived to retrieve the rest of her belongings and sees a Kindle which was gifted to her by Hardin for her birthday. Hardin's mother, Trish, arrives with him, and the pair are forced to pretend they are still together as Hardin did not inform her about their breakup. The next day, Tessa leaves to meet her mother, Carol, and her ex-boyfriend, Noah. Tessa arrives in front of her mother's house to learn from Noah that her father came to see her, but Carol sent him away. Angered, Tessa reunites with Hardin.

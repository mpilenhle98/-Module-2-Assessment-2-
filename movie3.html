When Gru refuses to return to being a supervillain, and his assistant Dr. Nefario is frozen in carbonite, most of his Minions, led by Mel, abandon him to find new jobs. Dave and Jerry stay behind, but the rest of the Minions have several misadventures throughout the film, eventually landing in jail.A butler named Fritz arrives at Gru's home with an invitation from Gru's long-lost twin Dru, who lives in a distant country named Freedonia. The family travels to meet Dru, and are surprised by his immense wealth and massive mansion. Fritz attributes this success to their large pig farming business. Meanwhile, Bratt steals the diamond again, intending to use it to power a giant robot that will destroy Hollywood in revenge for the cancellation of "Evil Bratt".

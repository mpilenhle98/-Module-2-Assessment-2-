One warrior ingests a heart-shaped herb affected by the vibranium and finds that he is suddenly bestowed with super-human powers. He becomes the first Black Panther. His first accomplishment is to unite all but one of the tribes, forming the new nation of Wakanda. They use the vibranium to become a technological superpower, but isolate themselves and hide from the rest of the world by pretending to be a third world nation.
